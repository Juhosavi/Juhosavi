<h3>SpaceCat</h3>
<p>SpaceCat was my very first game project, developed by a 4-person team over the course of three months. Itâ€™s a 2D platformer where the player navigates through alien-infested levels, collecting diamonds to earn points, destroying enemies along the way, and ultimately reaching a rocket to return home. I handled most of the code, including character movement, enemy AI, and scoring systems and the core gameplay mechanics. </p>
